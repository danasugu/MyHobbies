                    If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. That's crazy.


                    Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. You can spend all day playing with mountains. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. The light is your friend. Preserve it.
