                If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. That's crazy.

Don't fiddle with it all day. Learn when to stop. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

This is the fun part Every day I learn. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.
